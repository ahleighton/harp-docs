*************************************************
Clock Synchronizer
*************************************************

Clock Synchronizer devices, when in “Generator” mode, output a clocksignal that can be used to synchronise up to 6 other Harp devices. If set to “Repeater” mode, they will instead propagate a clock signal received from a different "Generator" Clock Synchronizer device, so that more than 6 devices can be synchronized to the same clock.



Key Features
- Can be used as a Generator (up to 6 devices) or Repeater.
- Synchronization error: ± 42 µS

Connectivity
- 1x clock sync input (CLKIN) [stereo jack]
- 1x USB (for power) [USB type B]
- 6x clock sync output (CLKOUT1 to CLKOUT6) [stereo jack]

Use
- Use the Clock Synchronizer in any setup requiring clock synchronization across Harp devices.
